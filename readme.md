# Library Management System (LMS)

## How to use it?
1. Create a folder named `assets` and within it, another folder named `users`. This is the path where the user data (id and password) is stored.
2. Create a text file named `meta.txt`. This file is used to load the necessary files before startup and provides the compiler with the names of the files to read and delete after loading.

## Functionality
1. You can create accounts by signing up and then log in to the Library.
2. The LMS has the following functions:
   - Adding books
   - Deleting books
   - Searching by id and name
   - Displaying books
   - Lending books
   - and more
3. You are welcome to make any desired changes to make the system work better.

## Implementation Details
This LMS has been implemented using structs, structs of arrays, error handling, and many more.
