HOW TO USE IT?
	Firstly you have to create a folder named assets and in assets another folder named users. It is the path where the data of users are kept (their id and password). You also have to create a text file named meta.txt.This text file is used to load the files before startup and also gives the compiler the file names to read and delete after loading.
Functionality:
1. You can create accounts by signing in and after this, you can log in to the Library.
2. The LMS has the functions :
a. Adding books
b. Deleting books.
c. Searching by id and name.
d. Displaying books.
e. Lending books and much more.
d. You can make any desired change to make it work better.
	I have used structs, structs of arrays, used handling, and many more.
